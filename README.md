Netflix India Content Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes Netflix India’s content catalog to identify trends in content type, genre distribution, language, release timelines, and duration. Using publicly available datasets, the analysis focuses on understanding how Netflix’s India-specific offerings have evolved over time and what patterns emerge across different categories.

The primary objective of this project is to practice end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) and develop the ability to translate raw data into meaningful, interpretable insights.

Datasets

The analysis is based on three CSV files related to Netflix India’s catalog:

Movies_and_Shows.csv

Shows.csv

Seasons.csv

These datasets contain metadata such as content type, genre, language, release year, and duration.

Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess multiple datasets by handling missing values and inconsistencies

Explore trends in content type, genre, language, and duration

Analyze changes in Netflix India’s catalog over time

Visualize patterns to support exploratory insights

Key Insights

Growth in Indian content increased notably after 2018, particularly in scripted series.

Drama and comedy are the most represented genres, with steady growth in niche formats such as documentaries and stand-up.

English and Hindi dominate the catalog, while regional language content shows gradual expansion.

A large portion of content falls within shorter duration ranges, indicating a preference for compact formats.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates a structured approach to exploratory data analysis using real-world entertainment data. It highlights the process of cleaning raw datasets, exploring patterns through visualization, and interpreting trends in a business-relevant context.
