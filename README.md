# Tata iQ – GenAI‑Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation

## 📌 Overview
This project documents my completion of the **Tata iQ – GenAI‑Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com).  
In this simulation, I acted as an **AI Transformation Consultant** for a fictional financial services client, **Geldium Finance**, tasked with reducing **credit card delinquency rates** using **Generative AI‑powered analytics tools**.

The simulation covered the full analytics workflow — from understanding the business problem to delivering AI‑driven recommendations — while emphasizing **ethical, explainable, and responsible AI use**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Leverage **GenAI-assisted analytics** to explore data, identify delinquency risk patterns, and build predictive insights.
- Recommend an actionable, ethical strategy to help the client reduce delinquency and improve collections efficiency.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **GenAI tools** – ChatGPT, Gemini (for insight generation & predictive modeling)
- **Data visualization** – Excel / Power BI (for exploratory visual analysis)
- **Business reporting** – PowerPoint, PDF
- **Documentation** – Forage platform workflow

---

## 🏷 Skills Demonstrated
- AI-assisted data exploration & insight generation
- Predictive risk modeling (no-code, GenAI-driven)
- Data ethics & bias mitigation
- Business reporting & storytelling
- Client-focused problem framing

## 📂 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Understanding the Problem
- Client: Geldium Finance, a credit card provider.
- Business challenge: High customer delinquency rates impacting profitability and operations.
- Goal: Identify high‑risk customers early and implement targeted interventions.

---

### 2️⃣ Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Loaded and examined dataset containing customer demographics, transaction history, repayment history, and account details.
- Checked for:
  - Missing or inconsistent values
  - Outliers and anomalies
  - Potential data leakage
- Used **GenAI prompts** to assist in interpreting column meanings and potential data issues.

---

### 3️⃣ GenAI‑Powered Predictive Modeling
- Selected **no-code modeling approach** guided by GenAI to predict customer delinquency risk.
- Considered:
  - **Model interpretability** (explainable outputs for business stakeholders)
  - **Performance trade-offs** (accuracy vs. transparency)
- Used GenAI to:
  - Suggest features most correlated with delinquency
  - Interpret feature importance in a business‑friendly manner

---

### 4️⃣ Ethical AI Considerations
- Identified possible biases in:
  - Demographic data usage
  - Historical repayment patterns
- Recommended:
  - Removing or minimizing sensitive attributes in modeling
  - Transparency in how predictions are generated
  - Ensuring AI outputs are reviewed by human analysts before actioning

---

### 5️⃣ Insights & Recommendations
- High-risk customer profiles share common features:
  - Low repayment-to-credit ratio
  - High utilization rates
  - Frequent missed payment history
- Suggested **tiered intervention strategy**:
  - Early engagement for moderate-risk customers
  - Customized repayment plans for high-risk customers
- Recommended periodic re-training of the predictive model to maintain accuracy and fairness.
