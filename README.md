# Tata Group Data Analytics Simulation – Forage (Aug 2025)

This repository contains my completed work for the Tata Group Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program on Forage. The simulation involved a real-world business scenario where data analytics and generative AI were used to develop insights and guide strategic decisions.

## 🧠 Objective

Analyze customer behavior data to:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns and risk indicators
- Build a framework for predictive modeling (no-code)
- Recommend an AI-driven business strategy
- Ensure fairness, transparency, and regulatory compliance

## 🔍 What I Did

- 🧹 **Cleaned and explored customer-level data**
  - Identified key variables: missed payments, credit utilization, debt ratio
  - Addressed missing data using statistical imputation
  - Used GenAI to summarize insights and recommend preprocessing

- 📈 **Designed a predictive modeling plan**
  - Proposed logistic regression and random forest frameworks
  - Defined evaluation strategy (accuracy, precision, AUC)
  - Created a SMART intervention plan based on model insights

- 🤖 **Outlined an agentic AI system**
  - Separated autonomous vs human-reviewed decisions
  - Designed responsible AI guardrails (bias checks, explainability, GDPR)

- 💼 **Mapped out business impact**
  - Projected reduction in delinquency
  - Recommended a scalable, automated outreach strategy
  - Balanced operational efficiency with customer fairness

## 💬 Why This Matters

This project simulates the end-to-end workflow of a data analyst or strategy analyst in a real-world setting — from data cleanup to insight generation to presenting an AI-driven recommendation to business stakeholders.  
It demonstrates both **technical reasoning** and **business impact thinking** — critical for roles in analytics, product strategy, and data science.
